            h3 Ruby on Rails
            p Since building my first Rails application back in 2007 I have loved the
              | beauty and simplicity of the Ruby language. One of my favorite features
              | of Rails has to be size of its community thats builds gems and contributes
              | to the Rails codebase itself. There seems to be a entire vibe that surrounds 
              | open source.

            h3 React, Redux, ES6, NPM and Node
            p Before Node.js even came around I was building full web applications 
              | in pure JS. I love the patterns and practices of React, but I dont mind going 
              | outside of its boundries when needed. I also really enjoy working with architectures 
              | centered around asynchronous JSON and small data end points.

            h3 Postgres and Mongo
            p PostgreSQL is a powerful, open source object-relational database system and Mongo 
              | is a NoSQL document store, containing many different key-value pairs, or even 
              | nested documents. Two drastically different approaches to deal with data that each
              | have their pros and cons.

            p Structural and stylistic scripting that each have very powerful features for everything 
              | from canvas(drawing) to animations. The more we can move stuff like animations 
              | to creative css and out of javascript is a huge win. It is stylistic after all.

              p Built a front-end framework, to search MLS's through a natural language search
                | feature. Using complex REGEX patterns we use autocomplete to match records and 
                | display results as the user enters search criteria. We achieve this by leveraging the performance
                | of JS's non-blocking asynchronous nature for performance which is able to query 
                | multiple data sources at once. Our very small team beat massive companies to win...
