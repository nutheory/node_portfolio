            h3 Ruby on Rails
            p Since building my first Rails application back in 2007 I have loved the
              | beauty and simplicity of the Ruby language. One of my favorite features
              | of Rails has to be the size of its community. The Ruby gems and contributions
              | from fellow Ruby developers can be leveraged for efficient application 
              | development.

            p Before Node's existence, I was building full web applications using
              | pure JS. I love the patterns and practices of React, but I don't mind going 
              | outside of its boundries when needed. The evolution of build systems has been a 
              | fun adventure to follow, from Grunt... to Gulp... to Webpack. I also 
              | enjoy working within a service oriented architecture that lends itself  
              | to proper separation of concerns. I also love clean API's with well formed
              | JSON responses.

            p PostgreSQL is a powerful, open source object-relational database system and Mongo 
              | is a NoSQL document store, containing many different key-value pairs, or even 
              | nested documents. Two drastically different approaches to deal with data, each
              | with pros and cons.

              | flexbox layouts cannot be underestimated.

          h1 About Me
          h4 My Beginnings
          p I created my first website in 1994, at the age of 13, and soon developed a focus on the 
            | user experience, or “usability,” aspects of web development.  I am largely self taught, 
            | with a strong work ethic, and over the past 20 years have gained practical experience 
            | with all sorts of languages, building my first web application in ASP.NET.  

          h4 My Recent History
          p I got started with Ruby on Rails in 2007, creating many different projects over the years.  
            | In 2009, I helped build a social network using PHP and pure Javascript 
            | (no libraries, no jQuery) called 
            a(href="http://miio.com/" target="_blank") Miio 
            | (
            a(href="https://github.com/nutheory/miio" target="_blank") github for Miio
            | ). Most recently I have 
            | created and maintained 5 full RoR applications at W+R Studios, along with prototyping 
            a(href="https://github.com/nutheory/mlx-map" target="_blank") proof of concepts for 
            | many major features using small Node/Express apps in order to get feedback. My last 
            | project at W+R Studios was 
            a(href="http://cloudmlx.com" target="_blank") Cloud MLX 
            | which won the 
            a(href="http://www.inman.com/2016/08/05/inman-announces-2016-innovator-award-winners/" target="_blank") 2016 Innovative Technology Award (from Inman)  
            | . My current contract is building an app for event based professionals. Its a RoR back end matched with a React/Redux front end.

          h4 My Future
          p I'm looking for an opportunity to work in an environment of aspirational projects and 
            | productive expectations.  I enjoy working with small teams, in collaborative efforts 
            | with others who are productive, proud of their work, and committed to excellence. I 
            | appreciate working with team players that are open minded.

                p "Derek Rush was the first developer hired by W+R Studios. From the beginning Derek 
                  | has shown great vision with our flagship product and contributed to many favorable 
                  | enhancements. Derek has also been instrumental contributing to the development 
                  | of two additional products with key innovations that separates us from the 
                  | competition. Derek is a strong collaborator with fellow teammates and has 
                  | mentored new developers along the way. If you are considering adding to your team

                | feature. Using complex Regex patterns we use autocomplete to match records and 
                | display results as the user enters search criteria. We achieve this by leveraging the performance
                | of JS's non-blocking asynchronous nature, which is able to query 
                | multiple data sources at once. Our very small team beat massive companies to win...

              p My first project at W+R Studios was an online comparative market analysis (CMA) report 
                | generator for real estate agents. My first big edit was to rewrite all prototype.js code in jQuery.
                | I was able to add many features over time, such as the "Whats your home worth?" 
                | lead capturer and the very experimental bookmarklet which would generate CMA's through our API
                | from other MLS systems results (this feature eventually got rolled into MLX). I also built 
                | the iPad version of Cloud CMA.

                | The app allows real estate agents or their clients to set the criteria 
                | for homes they’re interested in being notified about.
                | One of the many awesome features about this application is it’s  
                a(href="http://blog.cloudcma.com/listings-alerts-on-all-major-portals-pretty-much-suck/" target="_blank") performance
                | . Cloud Streams alerts were proven to be sent out faster than Zillow, Redfin, 
                | Realtor.com and many more. This was due to leveraging the power of 
                | Elasticsearch and delivery services like Twilio and SendGrid.
