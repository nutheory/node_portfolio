            h3 Ruby on Rails
            p Since building my first Rails application back in 2007 I have loved the
              | beauty and simplicity of the Ruby language. One of my favorite features
              | of Rails has to be size of its community thats builds gems and contributes
              | to the Rails codebase itself. There seems to be a entire vibe that surrounds 
              | open source.

            h3 Node.js
            p Before Node.js even came around I was building full web applications 
              | in pure JS. I really love working with JS because its blazingly
              | fast, and lightweight. I also really enjoy working with architectures 
              | centered around asynchronous JSON and small data end points. 
            p Note that this site was built using Node.js, Express, and Gulp.

              img(src="images/mlx.png")
              p Built a front-end framework, to search MLS's through a natural language search
                | feature. Using complex REGEX patterns we use autocomplete to match records and 
                | display results as the user enters search criteria. We achieve this by leveraging the performance
                | of JS's non blocking asynchronous nature for performance which is able to query 
                | Rails, HTML5 localstorage, and a ElasticSearch Server all at once. This framework was 
                | influenced by Rob Eisenbergs Aurelia, with only leveraging core concepts for loading 
                | speed. Look for it soon.

              p My first project at W&R, this is a online CMA generator for real estate agents. 
                | I was able to add many features over time, such as the "Whats your home worth?" 
                | lead capturer, and the iPad version of cloudCMA. I was constantly working with every department 
                | to achieve this.
