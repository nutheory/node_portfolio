beauty and simplicity of the Ruby language. One of my favorite features
of Rails has to be the size of its community. The Ruby gems and contributions
from fellow Ruby developers can be leveraged for efficient application 
development. </p></div></div><div class="right"> <div class="icon-jest"></div><div class="summary"> <h3>Jest, and Webpack <span>(testing and bundling)</span></h3><p>Before Node's existence, I was building full web applications using
pure JS. I love the patterns and practices of React, but I don't mind going 
outside of its boundries when needed. The evolution of build systems has been a 
fun adventure to follow, from Grunt... to Gulp... to Webpack. I also 
enjoy working within a service oriented architecture that lends itself  
to proper separation of concerns. I also love clean API's with well formed
JSON responses. <a href="http://github.com/nutheory/node_portfolio/" target="_blank">View this porfolio on Github  </a></p></div></div></div><div class="row"> <div class="left"><div class="icon-db"></div><div class="summary"><h3>Sequelize with Postgres and Mongo <span>(databases)</span></h3><p>PostgreSQL is a powerful, open source object-relational database system and Mongo 
is a NoSQL document store, containing many different key-value pairs, or even 
nested documents. Two drastically different approaches to deal with data, each
with pros and cons.       </p></div></div><div class="right"> <div class="icon-utils"></div><div class="summary"><h3>Git, Flow, and Ruby on Rails <span>(utils and extra talents)</span></h3><p>This is normally a "duh" section on a resume. But with the advancement of the

flexbox layouts cannot be underestimated.</p></div></div></div></div></div><div id="about"><div class="left-description"><h1>About Me</h1><h4>My Beginnings</h4><p>I created my first website in 1994, at the age of 13, and soon developed a focus on the 
user experience, or “usability,” aspects of web development.  I am largely self taught, 
with a strong work ethic, and over the past 20 years have gained practical experience 
with all sorts of languages, building my first web application in ASP.NET.  </p><h4>My Recent History</h4><p>I got started with Ruby on Rails in 2007, creating many different projects over the years.  
In 2009, I helped build a social network using PHP and pure Javascript 
(no libraries, no jQuery) called <a href="http://miio.com/" target="_blank">Miio </a>(<a href="https://github.com/nutheory/miio" target="_blank">github for Miio</a>). Most recently I have 
created and maintained 5 full RoR applications at W+R Studios, along with prototyping <a href="https://github.com/nutheory/mlx-map" target="_blank">proof of concepts for </a>many major features using small Node/Express apps in order to get feedback. My last 
project at W+R Studios was <a href="http://cloudmlx.com" target="_blank">Cloud MLX </a>which won the <a href="http://www.inman.com/2016/08/05/inman-announces-2016-innovator-award-winners/" target="_blank">2016 Innovative Technology Award (from Inman)  </a>. My current contract is building an app for event based professionals. Its a RoR back end matched with a React/Redux front end.</p><h4>My Future</h4><p>I'm looking for an opportunity to work in an environment of aspirational projects and 
productive expectations.  I enjoy working with small teams, in collaborative efforts 
with others who are productive, proud of their work, and committed to excellence. I 
appreciate working with team players that are open minded.</p></div><div class="right-history"><h1>History</h1><ul><li> <h4>W+R Studios (2011 - 2016)</h4><p>Over the span of several years I assisted in maintaining and launching 
4 SAAS/Rails projects within a small, agile team for the real estate industry. Most 
recently creating a custom front end framework to consume a Rails JSON API.</p><blockquote><h4>Testimonial</h4><p>"Derek Rush was the first developer hired by W+R Studios. From the beginning Derek 
has shown great vision with our flagship product and contributed to many favorable

aerial photographs and videos of properties for marketing residential homes. 
Basically this service acts as a job board for licensed drone pilots to find local filming 
opportunities for fast cash do what they love. This site was built with Node and React, and powered 
by GraphQL and PostgreSQL. </p><p>This project also takes full advantange of some great API's to handle 
a lot of heavy lifting like video transcoding, payment processing and file storage.</p><div class="actions"><a href="#" class="button green">Coming Soon...</a></div></div></div><div class="proj-col"><div class="proj"><h3> <a href="http://cloudmlx.com" target="_blank">Cloud MLX</a></h3><img src="images/mlx.jpg"><p>Built a front end framework to search MLS's through a natural language search
feature. Using complex Regex patterns we use autocomplete to match records and 
display results as the user enters search criteria. We achieve this by leveraging the performance
of JS's non-blocking asynchronous nature, which is able to query 
multiple data sources at once. Our very small team beat massive companies to win.</p><div class="award"><a href="http://www.inman.com/2016/08/05/inman-announces-2016-innovator-award-winners/" target="_blank"><div class="img"></div></a><div class="text"> <a href="http://www.inman.com/2016/08/05/inman-announces-2016-innovator-award-winners/" target="_blank"> <h3>2016 </h3><h4>Inman Most Innovative Technology</h4></a></div></div><div class="actions"><a href="http://cloudmlx.com" target="_blank" class="button green">cloudmlx.com</a></div></div></div><div class="proj-col"><div class="proj"><h3> <a href="http://thebrainfactory.com" target="_blank">The Brain Factory</a></h3><img src="images/brain.jpg"><p>The Brain Factory specializes in immersive entertainment, and is the company responsible for the

generator for real estate agents. My first big edit was to rewrite all prototype.js code in jQuery.
I was able to add many features over time, such as the "Whats your home worth?" 
lead capturer and the very experimental bookmarklet which would generate CMA's through our API
from other MLS systems results (this feature eventually got rolled into MLX). I also built 
the iPad version of Cloud CMA.</p><p><a href="http://blog.cloudcma.com/getting-the-most-from-cloud-cmas-whats-my-home-worth-lead-generating-landing-pages/" target="_blank">Blog: Whats your home worth  </a></p><div class="actions"><a href="http://blog.cloudcma.com/getting-the-most-from-cloud-cmas-whats-my-home-worth-lead-generating-landing-pages/" target="_blank" class="button green">cloudcma.com</a></div></div></div><div class="proj-col"><div class="proj"><h3> <a href="http://www.cloudstreams.net/" target="_blank">Cloud Streams</a></h3><img src="images/streams.png"><p>Cloud Streams delivers property alerts via email or SMS in lightning speed. 
The app allows real estate agents or their clients to set the criteria for homes they’re 
interested in being notified about. One of the many awesome features about this application 
is it’s <a href="http://blog.cloudcma.com/listings-alerts-on-all-major-portals-pretty-much-suck/" target="_blank">performance</a>. Cloud Streams alerts were proven to be sent out faster than Zillow, Redfin, 
Realtor.com and many more. This was due to leveraging the power of Elasticsearch and delivery 
services like Twilio and SendGrid.    </p><div class="actions"><a href="http://www.cloudstreams.net/" target="_blank" class="button green">cloudstreams.net </a></div></div></div></div></div></div><div id="contact"><div class="actions"><a href="resume.pdf" target="_blank" class="button">Resume</a><a href="mailto:drush@nutheory.com" class="button pink">Contact    </a></div></div></div></body></html>
