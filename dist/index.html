Fullstack web developer using<br>Ruby and Javascript</h2></header><div id="tools"><h1>My development toolset.</h1><div class="top-center"><div class="left-rails"> <div class="icon-rails"></div><h3>Ruby on Rails</h3><p>Since building my first Rails application back in 2007 I have loved the
beauty and simplicity of the Ruby language. One of my favorite features
of Rails has to be size of its community thats builds gems and contributes
to the Rails codebase itself. There seems to be a entire vibe that surrounds 
open source.</p></div><div class="right-node"> <div class="icon-node"></div><h3>Node.js</h3><p>Before Node.js even came around I was building full web applications 
in pure JS. I really love working with JS because its blazingly
fast, and lightweight. I also really enjoy working with architectures 
centered around asynchronous JSON and small data end points. </p><p>As a matter of fact this site was built using Node.js, Express, and Gulp.</p></div></div><ul class="minor-tools"><li class="mongo"><div class="icon-mongo"></div><h4>MongoDB  </h4><p>NoSQL document store, containing many different key-value pairs, or even nested documents.</p></li><li class="github"><div class="icon-github"></div><h4>GitHub</h4><p>Collaboration, code review, and code management for open source and private projects.</p></li><li class="sass"><div class="icon-sass"></div><h4>SASS</h4><p>SASS is an extension of CSS, adding nested rules, variables, mixins, and selector inheritance. </p></li><li class="postgres"><div class="icon-postgres"></div><h4>Postgres</h4><p>PostgreSQL is a powerful, open source object-relational database system.</p></li><li class="gulp"><div class="icon-gulp"></div><h4>Gulp</h4><p> Gulp is a streaming code-over-configuration build system for Node.js.</p></li><li class="html"><div class="icon-html"></div><h4>HTML5, HAML and Jade</h4><p>Three ways to write structural markup for any interface.</p></li></ul></div><div id="about"><div id="me"><img src="images/headshot.png" alt="Derek"></div><div class="left-description"><p>I am a highly motivated web application developer, and designer

4 SAAS/Rails projects on a small agile team for the real estate industry. Most 
recently creating a custom front-end framework to consume a Rails JSON API.</p></li><li><h3>2001 - 2007: Foldera</h3><p>Co-founded a software company that was aimed to improve project management
and collaboration. My role was Lead Designer/Usability Engineer.</p></li></ul></div><div style="clear:both"> </div><div class="testimonial">"Derek Rush was the first developer hired by W&R Studios. From the beginning Derek 
has shown great vision with our flagship product and contributed to many favorable 
enhancements. Derek has also been instrumental contributing to the development 
of two additional products with key innovations that separates us from the 
competition. Derek is a strong collaborator with fellow Teammates and has 
mentored new developers along the way. If you are considering adding to your Team 
Derek is a proven asset every successful Company should have." ~ Gary McDaniel - 
Director of Member Services, W&R Studios     </div></div><div id="projects"><div class="project-wrapper"><h1>Recent Projects</h1><ul><li><h3>CloudMLX</h3><img src="images/cloud-mlx-logo.png"><p>Built a front-end framework, to search MLS's through a natural language search
feature. Using complex REGEX patterns we autocomplete to match records and 
display results as the user types. We acheive this by leveraging the performance
of JS's non blocking asynchronous nature for performance. Look for it soon.</p></li><li><h3>CloudCMA</h3><img src="images/cloud.png"><p>My first project at W&R, this is a online CMA geberator for real esate agents 
I added many features, such as the "Whats your home worth?" lead capturer, 
and the iPad version of cloudCMA. I was constantly working with every department 
to achieve this.</p><p><a href="http://blog.cloudcma.com/getting-the-most-from-cloud-cmas-whats-my-home-worth-lead-generating-landing-pages/" target="_blank">Check it out!</a></p></li><li><h3>Nudge</h3><img src="images/nudge.png"><p>Nudge was a very simple email system to clients about changes in the real
