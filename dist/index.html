beauty and simplicity of the Ruby language. One of my favorite features
of Rails has to be size of its community thats builds gems and contributes
to the Rails codebase itself. There seems to be a entire vibe that surrounds 
open source.</p></div><div class="right-node"> <div class="icon-node"></div><h3>React, Redux, ES6, NPM and Node</h3><p>Before Node.js even came around I was building full web applications 
in pure JS. I love the patterns and practices of React, but I don't mind going 
outside of its boundries when needed. I also really enjoy working with architectures 
centered around asynchronous JSON and small data end points. </p></div><div class="left-db"><div class="icon-db"></div><h3>Postgres and Mongo</h3><p>PostgreSQL is a powerful, open source object-relational database system and Mongo 
is a NoSQL document store, containing many different key-value pairs, or even 
nested documents. Two drastically different approaches to deal with data, each
with pros and cons. </p></div><div class="right-5-3"> <div class="icon-5-3"></div><h3>HTML and CSS</h3><p>Structural and stylistic scripting tools, each having powerful features for everything 
from canvas (drawing) to animations. Huge gains can be achieved through moving 
page elements, such as animations, from JavaScript to creative CSS enhancements.  </p></div></div></div><div id="about"><div class="left-description"><p>I am a highly motivated web application developer/designer with 
9+ years of GUI experience, and have 8+ years working with Ruby on Rails.  
I also have extensive experience working with JavaScript.</p></div><div class="right-history"><h1>History</h1><ul><li> <h4>2011 - 2016: W+R Studios</h4><p>Over the span of several years I assisted in maintaining and launching 
4 SAAS/Rails projects within a small, agile team for the real estate industry. Most 
recently creating a custom front-end framework to consume a Rails JSON API.</p></li><li><h4>2001 - 2007: Foldera</h4><p>Co-founded a software company that was aimed to improve project management
and collaboration. My role was Lead Designer/Usability Engineer.</p></li></ul></div><div style="clear:both"> </div><div class="testimonial">"Derek Rush was the first developer hired by W+R Studios. From the beginning Derek 
has shown great vision with our flagship product and contributed to many favorable 
enhancements. Derek has also been instrumental contributing to the development 
of two additional products with key innovations that separates us from the 
competition. Derek is a strong collaborator with fellow teammates and has 
mentored new developers along the way. If you are considering adding to your team 
Derek is a proven asset every successful company should have." <span>~ Gary McDaniel - Director of Member Services, W+R Studios     </span></div></div><div id="projects"><div class="project-wrapper"><h1>Recent Projects</h1><ul><li><h3>CloudMLX</h3><img src="images/mlx.png"><p>Built a front-end framework, to search MLS's through a natural language search
feature. Using complex REGEX patterns we use autocomplete to match records and 
display results as the user enters search criteria. We achieve this by leveraging the performance
of JS's non-blocking asynchronous nature for performance which is able to query 
multiple data sources at once.
